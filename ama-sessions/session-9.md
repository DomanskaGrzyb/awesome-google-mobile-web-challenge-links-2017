#### Since the capacity of the channels messages is limited and I see some channels remove *totally* their history, does it mean that our old participation history is lost? does it mean that your evaluation on slack will be done using statistics over a limited time period not over all of the 3 months?
We’ve been (and we still are) carefully monitoring slack activity throughout the whole challenge phase.

#### How do you select the candidates?
The most important thing we look at is course completion. If you haven't completed the course material, then you're not eligible for round 2. If you have completed the course, then we look at your Slack and/or forum activity as well to see if you've been active in the community. An applicant who has completed the course and who engages with their peers is more likely to get into phase 2 over candidates who only finish the course. We have A LOT of tools, tables and programs that we'll be using during our selection process, but this is the TL;DR of how we're going to do it.

#### If we were active on the forum, and slack in the beginning, but not so much towards the end of the course, but we have passed the challenge, would that affect our 'score'?
You'll have more of a chance of getting in than people who haven't been active at all, but it really depends on the quality of your interactions in the beginning. That said, we encourage our students to be consistent throughout if possible as opposed to being front-heavy/back-heavy.

#### Does the other tracks have a github repo with most important links as we do? If yes I would love to know what the other tracks have learned so far .. and learn from them.
I think the best way to find it out for you would be to address this topic on the facebook group we created for all Scholarship students, from all the tracks: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1555541717869453/

#### Have you consider using discord (or other chat application)?
Definitely. We understand how limited the free version of Slack is and we're constantly looking for a way to improve our communication with our students moving forward. As a gamer myself, I love Discord but I also understand that some may be more reserved against using it because if it's hardcore gamer association. That said, anything is possible in the future and this is a conversation we're always having.

#### How many students do you currently have that are likely to pass to the second phase?
I can not comment on the specific number at the moment, but we already have more than the number needed for our selection process (1000 students for MWS). THAT SAID, there are students who have completed the program but choose to ignore the participation requirement completely (believe it or now), so if you're on slack and/or the forum, then you're already given priority over those students.

#### In phase 2 it'll also be system where we'll have to be active to successfully pass it or it was only for phase 1?
Phase 2 will be slightly different - you will be asked to submit your projects which will be then carefully reviewed by reviewers + you will be in touch with mentor. Your completed projects will be showcased in your portfolio and will be useful to reference during your job search. The community will of course still be there – both on Forums and Slack – but the level of your activity will not be so thoroughly measured anymore. We trust that once you started being active in Phase 1, this spirit won’t fade away in Phase 2.

#### If we are not selected, can we do the rest of the courses paying?
Yes, certainly! Students who do not make it into phase 2 but would still like to continue the course will receive a 20% discount if they choose to pay for the Nanodegree.

#### In many places I see that you were expecting 10 hours minimum a week. If we did not meet this expectation does it affect our selection?  (Even though we finished the course and we were active on slack and forum.)
Not at all. As long as you've completed the course and been active, it doesn't matter if you've spent 20 hours a week on the program or 1. Different people work at different paces and have different schedules. As long as all the criteria is met by Feb 6th, you're eligible for moving forward.

#### I have one more question, when it is time for phase 2, what will happen to slack and forum? I think only the 1000 selected people will be able to contribute but you were saying that it will also be open for people who were not selected. How is that work?
Slack, Forum and your classroom will stay open for one month after the end of Phase 1 (so beginning of March). Later on, we will provide you with the precise date and hour, together with some tips on how to use this remaining time the best. For the selected 6.000 students (10% from 60.000) we will open completely new Slack and Forums.

#### Who is evaluating our progress Google or Udacity? What are the best points are considered in engagement in the forum? Is it the number of likes received or reading time of posts? Is helping people has high points than others or writing topics and opening discussion in a topic? Could you please rank activities of form from high to low? Is the same methods of evaluating progress applied to other scholarships like OMAC scholarship?
Selection is done mostly by a team of Udacity Staff (Program Managers, us Community Managers, etc) and we're also in communication with Google during the week that we're burying our noses in the dozens of spreadsheets we have and use. As for going into the specifics of how we rank things, that's a whole other conversation and something that I don't think we're allowed to disclose (otherwise everyone would just do it and now have a mind of their own.  As for other Scholarships, we're only involved with Google Developer programs her in Europe and in the USA, so it's information I wouldn't have access to.

#### If you have more than 2 students at the same grade at 1000th place, will you pick both of them or not? If some students decide not to move on, is there any way to let other students who fallen out of range get reached for 2nd phase?
Re: your scenario of the 1000 and the 1001st student having the same level of activity and being finished the course, we have enough wiggle room to accept them both into phase 2. The scenario is unlikely, but if it happened, we'd take both.

#### Do you have specific tips ( special tips for the last week of the first phase), i.e. advice related to the last week especially for students who had completed the course earlier?
At this stage, I'd encourage you to spend time helping your peers get across that finish line and just being active in the community when you have the time to be.

#### I like  Udacity courses and  I'd like to do all the courses about Android. But I'd also like to be selected in the next phase. What can I do in the next days to try to be selected? Is it possible in the next phase to be inserted in a program about android and java?
If you get selected for Phase 2, you will be asked to follow the same track you started Phase 1 with. But of course, it does not mean you cannot expand your passion for Android on the side!

#### There is a kind of discount for taking the Google's Mobile Web Specialist Certification?
Nanodegree prepares you for taking the certification exam, however, we are currently not offering any discounts for the exam itself.

#### If we got through phase 2 and have any inconvenience during that time (professional or personal) it's there an option of deferring it?
In general students will not be able to pause their program, however, in case of _very special_ circumstances, we will try to take a look into edge cases.

#### I am still in the process of completing the course because I had other commitments earlier in the process. I plan to finish it this week, before the deadline. So that should not be an issue. My concern is that obviously interaction is graded as people keep mentioning. My problem is that when I am stuck on the course I search the forum and 99% of the time someone has already had the same problem as me and so I read the posts and solve my problem, so I have yet to have a reason to write my own post describing the help that I need. Should I instead just focus on replying to other people's posts? Will I be graded down because I haven't created my own posts? Or is posting on other people's threads equally valid? Is there certain things I need to do, or is it just general activity all added together? Do I need to try and collect the forum badges? I don't know what kind of activity I should be doing! It's hard to work out what to do in order to meet the selection criteria when the participation criteria is vague! p.s. to everyone else - I'm all up for helping other people so if you're stuck on something please gimme a shout!
I can see you're concerned about the participation grade and I can confidently say we don't only look at your ability to help others but just your general interaction with the community in general. With such a large community of students. it's really easy to get lost in conversation and so there are many things to get you active. Ask a question, answer a question, join a discussion, be part of a debate, just have casual conversations in your channel...really, any sort of activity can be counted. We don't expect our students to constantly help others out of the fear that they need to at all times. It's not a race and help should, ideally, come from your own willingness to offer it with reward.

Forum badges are just there for fun and have zero impact on who we select for next phase. Finish the course, and just have fun in these final 11 days. Chat, ask questions, post when and where you can. If you can't answer a question, no worries, post something else in a different thread. I'm sort of rambling now, but I hope this makes sense.

#### Any news about the feedback channel? do you prefer to launch it at the last week before the deadline so everyone could contribute?
Sadly we had to slightly postpone it due to launching #student-stories student-stories initiative. However, the channel is already there (#feedback) and we are planning to “properly” launch it very soon. So stay tuned!

#### Is this ama_sessions session going to be the last session for this phase?
Nope. We have a final technical AMA next week as well and another general one or two before Feb 6th

#### In case someone has finished the ES6 course before starting the challenge and it was set to done automatically on the challenge starting date. Should he re-do it again or not?
No, you don’t have to re-do it, all your progress is being saved.
